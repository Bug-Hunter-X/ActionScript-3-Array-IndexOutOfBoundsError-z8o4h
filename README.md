This repository demonstrates an uncommon ActionScript 3 error related to accessing very large array indices. ActionScript, like many languages, has limitations on memory allocation. When you try to access or create an array element with an index far beyond the available memory, an error occurs. This example highlights this error and a potential solution. The bug.as file contains the original code that causes the error. The bugSolution.as file provides a solution that avoids the memory issue.
